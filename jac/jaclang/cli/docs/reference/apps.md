# Workspaces & Apps

A Jac project declares apps by entry module. Each `[apps.<name>]` table names
an `entry-point` and a `kind`. A compilation starts in the app selected by the
CLI. Ordinary imports inherit that app's context; another declared entry is a
boundary. A project without `[apps]` has one implicit app.

Four principles hold the model together:

- **The boundary is structural, the topology is profile.** An app boundary
  always compiles and type-checks as a cut. Whether the apps on either side of
  it share one process, run as separate local processes, or run as separate
  pods is configuration, never source.
- **ACID within an app per request, eventual across apps.** One request
  against one app is one transaction. Anything that crosses an app boundary
  is a message.
- **No pass reads `jac.toml`.** The driver stamps *app facts* onto every
  module (selected app, project root, kind); the compiler's laws
  consume the stamps.
- **The platform is a stamped decision, never a filename property.** A
  `.native.jac` variant is selected for a mobile app's native platforms, not
  by where the file sits.

## The `[apps.<name>]` table

```toml
[project]
name = "acme"
default-app = "web"          # optional; a bare `jac run` uses it

[apps.web]                   # one table per app
kind = "web-app"             # required: a project kind
entry-point = "web.main"
platform = "android"         # optional default platform (mobile: android | ios | web; desktop: windows | macos | linux)
route = "/api/web"           # optional; default "/api/<name>" (apps with a server only)

[apps.social_graph]          # a declared service entry
kind = "service"
entry-point = "core.social_graph"
```

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | **Required.** One of the [project kinds](../quick-guide/project-kinds.md): `cli`, `cli-native`, `native-binary`, `native-lib`, `service`, `service-mesh`, `py-package`, `js-package`, `web-app`, `web-static`, `desktop`, `mobile`. The kind decides the default entry, the action a bare `jac run <app>` takes, what the client renders (`web-app`, `web-static`, `desktop` and `js-package` render React DOM; `mobile` renders native views through [`@jac/mobui`](plugins/jac-client.md#the-jacmobui-vocabulary), with the `E1105` host-tag guard on every module compiled in the app context), and whether the app has a server. |
| `entry-point` | string | **Required.** Dotted module name relative to the project root, such as `core.api`. File paths and extensions are rejected. |
| `platform` | string | Default platform: `android`, `ios` or `web` for a `mobile` app; `windows`, `macos` or `linux` for a `desktop` app. `--platform` on `jac run` / `jac build` overrides it for one invocation. |
| `route` | string | The app's public route prefix, for apps whose kind has a server. Must start with `/`. Defaults to `/api/<name>`. |

Entry points use the compiler's local module resolution without executing code.
`core.api` resolves `core/api.jac` (or its Python implementation); `core` can
resolve a package initializer. A missing module produces an entry-point diagnostic.
Placement pins use the same dotted naming style but also allow patterns:

```toml
[placement.pins]
"core.api" = "server"
"desktop.*" = "client"
```

Quote pin keys so TOML preserves each dotted name as one literal key. An entry
point must name one module and cannot contain a wildcard.

Any key other than these is a hard config error naming the accepted keys. App
names cannot contain `/` or `\` and cannot end in `.jac`, so that `jac run
<target>` can always tell an app name from a file path.

A nested table under an app -- `[apps.web.serve]`, `[apps.mobile.dependencies.npm]`,
`[apps.social_graph.scale]` -- is an **overlay**, covered under
[Effective configuration](#effective-configuration) below.

## Entry modules and shared source

App declarations identify entry modules. They do not claim directories. A helper
imported by two apps is compiled in each app's context, with shared parsed syntax
and distinct semantic facts and runtime module state. File location and
`default-app` do not select a global app context.

Imports through a declared service entry use its bridge surface: public functions
and walkers retain the provider's identity. A direct import of an ordinary
implementation module participates locally in the importing app; an entry-only
model cannot infer an undeclared private boundary. Keep cross-app APIs at their
declared entries.

`E2039`/`W2039` diagnose uses across declared app boundaries outside the bridge
surface. `[check] enforce_access` selects errors instead of warnings.

The removed `path` key is a configuration error. Migrate
`path = "web"` plus `entry-point = "main"` to
`entry-point = "web.main"`.

## The implicit single app

With no `[apps]` table the project is one app. Its name is `[project] name`
(or `"main"`), its kind is `[project] kind` (or inferred from the entry-point,
exactly as before), its entry is `[project] entry-point`, and its root is the
project root. Single-app entry points use the same dotted module syntax:

```toml
[project]
name = "hello"
entry-point = "main"
kind = "web-app"
```

The two forms are exclusive. `[project] kind` and `[project] entry-point`
cannot appear alongside `[apps]` -- the parser raises a hard error telling you
to move the key onto the app (`[apps.<name>] kind`), and the CLI exits 2.

## Effective configuration

Each app sees its own **effective config**, assembled in this order (later
layers win, tables deep-merge):

1. the base `jac.toml`;
2. the app's overlays -- every `[apps.<name>.<section>]` table, merged over the
   matching top-level `[<section>]`;
3. the active profile -- `jac.<profile>.toml` and/or `[environments.<profile>]`,
   selected by `--profile`, `JAC_PROFILE`, or `[environment] default_profile`;
4. `jac.local.toml`.

Any recognized section may be overlaid per app:

```toml
[serve]
port = 8000                        # every app that serves

[apps.web.serve]
port = 3000                        # ...except web

[apps.mobile.dependencies.npm]     # merged over the base [dependencies.npm]
lucide-react-native = "^0.4"

[apps.social_graph.scale]          # per-app scale settings (replicas, resources, ...)
http_activation = true

[apps.web.placement.pins]          # per-app pins merged over the base [placement.pins]
"core.docs.*" = "server"

[apps.kiosk.desktop]               # a desktop app's identity, window and backend
backend = "https://example.org"
```

`jac run web` reads `serve.port` from the `web` effective config; `jac test
mobile` reads `[test]` from the `mobile` effective config and resolves its
`directories` against the entry module’s directory; `jac config` shows the base file, and the
`apps` group lists the app tables.

`${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}` and `${VAR:?message}` interpolation applies to
**every** string in the file, uniformly -- app tables, overlays, profiles, and
capability tables alike. There are no sections where it is skipped.

`default-app` names the app a bare `jac run`, `jac build`, `jac test`, or `jac
setup` targets. Without it, a workspace with exactly one app uses that app; a
workspace with several and no default errors, listing the apps.

## Ownership follows compilation context

Ordinary imported modules carry the selected app's identity, including their
walkers and persisted node/edge declarations. A service entry establishes a
separate provider context. Import that entry when multiple apps need the same
service or store. Colocated apps load distinct copies of ordinary shared-source
modules, so module globals are app-local.

No workspace consumer scan or app context cache is needed. `default-app` chooses a
CLI default; placement pins choose codespaces. Neither assigns shared code to a
global app context, and the former E5107 ambiguity gate has been removed.

## The app dependency graph

Every bridged import records an edge *consumer app → provider app*. The graph
has to be a DAG: apps bridge to their providers over the wire, and providers
boot first, so a cycle has no boot order. **`E5104`** names the cycle on the
import that closes it. Break it by moving the code both apps need into shared
code, or by folding one app into the other.

The **bridge surface** of an app follows the declaration: a `walker:pub` /
`def:pub` (anonymous) or `walker:protect` / `def:protect` (authenticated)
element is callable by any consumer app; a plain or `:priv` walker or function
is private to its own server and is not an endpoint at all. Bridging to a
private element is **`E5106`**. There are no per-app grants, and no config
entry changes exposure: `[placement.pins]` decides only where code runs.

## Routes

An app with a server answers under its `route`, default `/api/<name>`. Routes
are checked at config load: two serving apps claiming the same prefix, or an
app claiming a prefix a page owns, is a hard config error.

When you `jac run <app>` a client-capable app, that app is served at `/`.
Other client-capable apps in the workspace whose bundle has been built
(`jac build --all` writes `dist/<app>/`) are mounted at `/cl/<app-name>/` --
a constant prefix, with no config key. The API index, `/docs`, `/walker/*` and
`/function/*` belong to the served app as before.

## Working with a workspace

Every command that used to take a filename now takes an **app name or a
path**. A target that matches a key in `[apps]` is an app; anything else is a
file. There is no `--app` flag on `run`/`build`/`test`/`setup` -- the
positional is the interface.

```bash
jac run                      # the default-app (or the sole app), per its kind
jac run web                  # serve the web app (web-app kinds serve)
jac run cli -- score jaseci-labs/jac      # execute the cli app; argv after --
jac run --dev --platform web mobile       # run the mobile app in a browser (react-native-web)
jac run --show               # one plan row per app: app, kind, entry, action, ui, route
jac run web --fleet          # serve web; run the service apps as separate local processes

jac build                    # the default app's artifact into dist/
jac build --all              # every app into dist/<app>/
jac build mobile --platform ios

jac check                    # the workspace gate (below)
jac check --app web          # one app only
jac test social_graph        # [test] from that app's effective config, rooted at the app
jac setup mobile             # the app named mobile; `jac setup` alone is the default app

jac create myproj --kind web-app         # a single-app project, as before
jac create --app scoring --kind service  # scaffold an app inside this project
jac create --app admin --kind web-app --path tools/admin
jac create mysite --awesome              # the flagship workspace, below
```

`jac create --app <name> --kind <kind>` writes the app's files under
`<path>/` (default: the app name) and appends an `[apps.<name>]` table to the
project's `jac.toml`, leaving the rest of the file intact.

**`jac check` is the workspace gate.** With no paths in a workspace it traverses
imports from each declared entry, plus conventional page roots for client apps.
Shared helpers are checked in each app context that reaches them. When several
apps are checked, diagnostics carry an app prefix. `--app <name>` selects one
context; explicit paths remain explicit roots. Unreachable files must be named
explicitly to check them. Cache slots include the entry and compilation context,
so one app's analyzed artifacts cannot overwrite another's.

## Worked example: the flagship workspace

`jac create <name> --awesome` scaffolds jaclang.org itself -- five apps over
one shared `core/`:

```toml
[project]
name = "jaclang_org"
default-app = "web"

[apps.web]                     # the site: landing, docs, leaderboard, socialize, wasm game
kind = "web-app"
entry-point = "web.main"

[apps.mobile]                  # a mobUI (React Native) client for the same social graph
kind = "mobile"
entry-point = "mobile.main"

[apps.cli]                     # a command-line client: offline scorer + docs/feed over the wire
kind = "cli"
entry-point = "cli.main"

[apps.social_graph]            # file-rooted service app: owns the socialize walkers
kind = "service"
entry-point = "core.social_graph"

[apps.scoring]                 # file-rooted service app: owns the leaderboard scorer
kind = "service"
entry-point = "core.scoring_service"

[test]
directories = ["core", "web", "cli"]

[apps.web.client.vite]         # web-only client settings stay on the web app
plugins = ["tailwindcss()"]
```

```
jaclang_org/
  core/            shared domain + logic: NO JSX, NO DOM
    social_graph.jac       ← [apps.social_graph] claims exactly this file
    scoring_service.jac    ← [apps.scoring] claims exactly this file
    leaderboard/  docs/  source/  github.jac  utils.jac ...
  web/             the site (main.jac, pages/, docs/, leaderboard/, socialize/, ui/ ...)
  mobile/          screens/, components/, theme.jac, icon.jac + icon.native.jac
  cli/             main.jac, commands/
```

Read it top down. `core/social_graph.jac` declares the nodes, edges and
walkers of the social app -- one file, no routes, no serializers. The `web`
app's `socialize/` pages, the `mobile` app's screens, and the `cli` app's
`feed`/`post` commands all `import from core.social_graph { load_feed,
create_tweet, ... }` with a plain import. The compiler classifies each import
by the provider of what is imported: the `web` app's client code bridges over
HTTP as it always did; the `mobile` app's screens do the same from React
Native; the `cli` app -- server-side Python, but not the provider -- gets a
**typed-async stub** and `await`s the call. Nothing in the source says which
is which.

The `cli` app's `score` command imports `core.leaderboard.scoring` -- a pure
shared module -- and runs it offline, in-process. Same import form, no bridge,
because nothing server-placed is involved.

## The consistency model

**Within an app, one request is one transaction.** A walker spawned on the
`social_graph` app reads and writes that app's store atomically, exactly as a
single-app server does today.

**Across apps, consistency is eventual, and the write path is single-writer.**
A consumer never writes another app's store; it *ships a walker* to the provider
and the provider writes. Two shapes of shipping exist, chosen by whether you wait:

```jac
import from core.social_graph { create_tweet, load_feed }

# awaited: the result comes back, failures raise
walker:pub post_and_show {
    async can run with Root entry {
        posted = await create_tweet(content=self.text);   # runs on social_graph
        feed = await load_feed(limit=10);
        report feed.reports;
    }
}

# un-awaited, statement context: deferred delivery through the outbox
walker:pub fire_and_forget {
    can run with Root entry {
        create_tweet(content=self.text);   # enqueued; at-least-once; never raises here
        report "queued";
    }
}
```

- **Awaited** cross-app calls are coroutines (the type checker reports a
  missing `await` as `E1042`, in server code just as in client code). A
  failure raises one of the **`BridgeError`** family from
  `jaclang.server.bridge` -- `BridgeUnavailable` (no route to the provider),
  `BridgeTimeout`, `BridgeRejected` (the provider answered 4xx: not `pub`,
  unauthorized, bad arguments), or plain `BridgeError` (5xx) -- each carrying
  `app`, `name`, `detail` and `status`. Client apps get the same four classes
  from `@jac/runtime`. Exception parity with an in-process spawn is the
  contract: catch at the boundary where you want graceful degradation.
- **Un-awaited** cross-app walker spawns in statement position never raise at
  the call site. The spawn is written to an **outbox** inside the caller's
  request, then delivered to the provider by a background worker with
  exponential backoff (up to 8 attempts, then dead-lettered). Every entry
  carries an idempotency key (default: a hash of app, walker and arguments;
  pass your own when the arguments alone are not identity), sent as
  `X-Jac-Idempotency-Key`; the receiving app dedupes by key, so delivery is
  **at-least-once with idempotent receipt**. The outbox lives in the project's
  Postgres store when one is configured, else in `.jac/data/outbox.sqlite`.
- **Reads go to the provider** by default (provider-read). An app may opt into an
  in-process read cache for effect-free provider endpoints with
  `[apps.<consumer>.scale] read_cache = true`; the cache is invalidated when an
  effectful call to the same provider app goes through.

## Boundary is structural, topology is profile

Every app boundary is compiled as a cut whether or not the apps ever run
apart. Where they run is decided when you serve:

| Topology | How | What runs where |
|---|---|---|
| **Colocated** (default) | `jac run <app>` | Every service app is loaded into the served app's process and registered locally; bridged calls are in-process (still awaited, no HTTP). |
| **Local fleet** | `jac run <app> --fleet`, or `[scale.gateway] colocate = false` | Each service app is a separate local process behind the served app's gateway; bridged calls go over HTTP; peers find each other through `JAC_APP_<APP>_URL`. |
| **Deployed** | `jac scale deploy` | Always a fleet: each service app is its own Deployment/Service/HPA, the served app hosts the gateway, peer URLs are injected, and providers boot before their consumers (the DAG order). `colocate` is ignored. |

Fleet membership is the set of serving apps -- `web-app`, `service`, and
`service-mesh` kinds. The gateway's own knobs live under `[scale.gateway]`
(ports, timeouts, CORS, rate limiting, logs, tracing, shared volumes, `colocate`);
per-app scale settings live in the app's `[apps.<name>.scale]` overlay. See
[Scale -- HTTP API & Walkers](plugins/jac-scale-http.md#service-apps-cross-app-bridging)
and [Kubernetes & Operations](plugins/jac-scale-kubernetes.md#service-apps-in-kubernetes).
