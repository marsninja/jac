# Placement

Where each top-level element of your program runs -- server, client (browser),
or native -- is a **derived compiler fact**, computed by a whole-program
placement solver. You write plain Jac; the solver reads the evidence and
places every element. There is no placement syntax: the old `cl` / `sv` /
`na` markers were removed and no longer parse (run `jac fix placement` to
migrate marker-era code). When a decision must be overridden, the override
lives in `jac.toml` under `[placement.pins]`, not in the source.

## How placement is decided

Every module gets a **placement summary**: per top-level element, the
capability evidence it carries, its references to sibling elements, and its
value-flow escapes. Summaries are serialized into the module's `.jir` next to
the bytecode. The solver consumes summaries and owns every decision:

| Evidence | Pins toward |
|---|---|
| JSX construction, browser globals (`window`, `Date`, `setTimeout`, ...) | client |
| String-path (npm) imports | client |
| `root` access, node/edge/walker archetypes | server |
| Python imports not covered by the portability table | server |
| extern C declarations (clib imports) | native |
| `def:pub` / `def:protect` (and `walker:protect`), **in an app whose kind has a server** | server (as an endpoint contract) |
| A `[placement.pins]` entry (base table or the selected app's `[apps.<name>.placement.pins]` overlay) | its pinned space (immovable) |
| The entry file of a declared `service` app | server (the module is compiled in that app context) |

A bare `import from X { ... }` is classified by resolution, in a fixed order:
a local Jac module, then a name declared in `[dependencies.npm]` or owned by
the client framework (npm), then a Python module the importing file can
import (Python), and only then a package that is merely installed under
`.jac/client/node_modules` (npm). Declared dependencies win over a Python
module of the same name; a transitive npm package never captures a Python
import. `jac check --placements` names the rule that fired, for example
`NPM: npm dependency ([dependencies.npm])` or `PY: python import (python
module shadows the undeclared npm package)`.

`def:pub` and `def:protect` are the rows that depend on the **app kind**,
because `pub` means *export* client-side and *endpoint* server-side: neither
has a settled meaning until placement does. In a kind that has a server
(`web-app`, `service`, `service-mesh`, and the default when no kind is
declared) both are endpoint evidence -- an evidence-free `pub` or `protect`
there is deliberately an endpoint (`pub` anonymous, `protect` authenticated).
In a kind with no server (`js-package`, whose codespace is `client`;
`web-static`, `mobile`, `desktop`, `cli`) there is no server for it to mean,
so it is not evidence at all: everything lands client, `pub` means export, and
code carrying genuine server evidence is `E5087` rather than a server
placement that could only fail at runtime. The kind comes from the selected app context (`[apps.<name>] kind`, or
`[project] kind` for the implicit app). Ordinary imports inherit that context.

## App facts

Placement is computed in the selected app's compilation context.
`AppContextPass` stamps `app`, `app_root` (the project root), and `app_kind`
before semantic passes. Ordinary imports inherit the selected app;
another declared entry establishes a boundary. A shared helper can therefore
have different placements in a web, mobile, or CLI context without acquiring a
global app context.

Context-specific cache slots include the app entry, target, UI, memory, and
codespace settings. Project and app configuration fingerprints invalidate
artifacts when relevant declarations or pins change.

`E2039`/`W2039` check access through declared app entries: another app's private
declarations are unavailable outside its public bridge surface. Whether a
cross-module import is a plain in-process import, a client bridge, a
**service bridge** (server code importing server-placed elements compiled in a
different app), or a native binding is decided by one classifier over the same
facts; see [Cross-Codespace Interop](../internals/interop.md#one-cross-app-import-rule).

**Variant agreement.** A `.native.jac` variant is selected for a `mobile`
app's native platforms (android / ios; the base `.jac` serves its web
platform), never by its filename alone, and stands in for its sibling `.jac`
module. The two must expose the same public surface -- the
same names, kinds of declaration, parameter names and annotations, `has`
fields -- and each disagreement is `E5105`, reported on the variant.

**Portability by kind.** Whether a Python module may follow its referents
into another codespace is answered by `runtime/portability.jac`'s
`supports(module, space, kind)`: unrestricted on the server for every kind;
empty for the client space of every client-capable kind (honestly: nothing
lowers yet); the native table for native. So every Python import still pins
server, in every app.

From those seeds, placement propagates along symbol references to a fixpoint:
an element referenced by client code follows it into the bundle when its whole
closure can (**pulled client**); requirement-free elements reached from both
spaces compile into each (**dual emission**); and a reference whose closure
cannot move **bridges** instead -- exposed functions over RPC, archetypes as wire
types, native elements over the wasm edge. Cross-module pulls happen before
code generation, so `jac check` sees the same placements as `jac build`.

The RPC bridge is a *binding*, not a call-site rewrite: a `def:pub` or `def:protect` endpoint
reachable from client code is emitted into the bundle as an `async` forwarder
that calls it over HTTP, so the name works in every position -- called,
passed as a callback, stored, returned, re-exported. Because the forwarder is
async, its result is a `Promise<T>` where the server function's is `T`, which
`W6009` reports for value-returning endpoints. A client-side name that no
binding can cover is `E5086` at build time rather than a `ReferenceError` at
module load.

Exposure is decided by the declaration alone, in one place, and every stage
reads the same verdict: `def:protect` is an authenticated endpoint and gets a
client RPC forwarder like `def:pub`; a plain or `def:priv` function is private,
is never served, and a client import of it is `E5082`. The same verdict governs
cross-app imports (`E5106` for a private element). No pin or config entry
changes it.

The analysis proposes; lowering disposes. A module that prefers native but
fails to lower is demoted to the server with a note naming the cause, and a
client-pulled element that fails ES lowering demotes the same way (its call
sites bridge instead). The portability table
(`jaclang/runtime/portability.jac`) is the curated fact base for which
python modules may follow their referents into another space -- it is
honestly empty for the client today, so every python import pins server.

## Overriding placement: `[placement.pins]`

The escape hatch is a table in `jac.toml`. Keys are
[fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) patterns matched
against the element's dotted path (`module` or `module.element`, relative to
the project root); values are `"server"`, `"client"`, or `"native"`:

```toml
[placement.pins]
"app.API_KEY"   = "server"    # one element
"kernels.*"     = "server"    # every element of a module
helpers         = "client"    # module-level pin
```

A pin feeds the solver exactly like a source marker used to: the pinned
element is immovable and everything else re-solves around it. Pins are part
of the program -- changing them invalidates the compilation cache, and the
evidence chain reports them (`pinned 'server' ([placement.pins])`).

A pin is placement only. A **module-level `"server"` pin** anchors the module
server-side; it does not change which of its elements are endpoints or who may
call them -- that is the declaration's job (`:pub`, `:protect`, or private).

Declaring that a module runs as its own **service** is a different fact with
a different home: an `[apps.<name>]` table with `kind = "service"` and the
module as its `entry-point` (see [Workspaces & Apps](apps.md)). Its
elements are server-anchored by definition and compiled in that app context; imports of
them from any other app lower to typed-async bridge stubs.

## Seeing and reviewing placements

- `jac check --placements` prints every element's space with the evidence
  chain behind it ("seeded client: jsx construction", "dual client: pulled
  through plain import from app.jac", "demoted server: failed ES lowering"),
  plus an estimated boundary-crossing count.
- Editor hover shows `placement: <space> (inferred)` for any symbol, with a
  `dual` tag when the element is emitted into both spaces.

## Consuming placement: the facts API

The solver is the only thing that computes placement; everything else reads
its verdict. The single query surface is
`jaclang.compiler.placement.placement_facts`:

- `module_spaces(mod)` rolls a compiled module's element-level verdicts up to
  the set of codespaces it emits into (`{"server"}`, `{"client"}`, a mixed
  set, ...); `is_client_only(mod)` / `emits_server_code(mod)` are the common
  questions asked of that rollup.
- `discover_spaces(paths)` answers the same question for a batch of source
  files by running the stamps-only placement compile (no codegen); the deploy
  seal uses it to skip client-only modules -- pinned *and* inferred -- instead
  of parsing them into pod bytecode.
- `sealed_spaces_for(path)` answers from a sealed image's
  `_precompiled/MANIFEST.json`, which persists the per-module verdict at seal
  time (manifest format 5), so post-build tools never re-derive placement.
- `pinned_module_space(path)` exposes the raw `[placement.pins]` *input*
  (base table merged with the selected app's overlay) for the few places that
  need explicit user intent rather than the solved verdict (app-kind
  inference).
- `compiler/placement/workspace.jac` is the compiler-side workspace reader:
  `app_for_path`, `serving_apps`, `app_fact_digest`. It
  parses `[apps]` permissively (validation is the project layer's job) and
  synthesizes the implicit app when there is no `[apps]` table.

Tools must not read `[placement.pins]` directly as if it were the placement
verdict -- pins are one input to the solver, and most client modules carry no
pin at all. Direct `placement_pins` imports are restricted to the solver
layer and enforced by a repository test.

## When do I still pin?

Pins are never *placement* facts -- the solver can infer those. They are
*meaning* facts dataflow cannot see:

| Category | Why inference cannot decide | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| Trust boundaries | A pure function can be *placeable* client-side yet *unsafe* there (secrets, price computation, validation) | `[placement.pins]` entry -> `"server"` |
| API contracts | An endpoint is a promise (auth, serialization, versioning) to parties outside the program | `def:pub` / `def:protect` on the declaration |
| Stateful identity | Fork-per-space vs single-home for a mutable glob are different programs; both sound | home the glob with its writers via a pin (see W6006) |
| Environment-dependent semantics | Clock / RNG / env / fs mean different things per space; dual emission changes observable behavior | pin an explicit home |
| Foreign-boundary facts | Ecosystem portability is not program dataflow | portability table + clib declarations |
| Cost mandates | The solver optimizes an average; you hold hard constraints it cannot know | a `"native"` pin as a performance mandate |
| Stability pins | A correct placement flip can still be operationally disruptive | a pin to hold an element where it is |

Punchline: placement syntax is unnecessary. What survives is the
pin-as-trust-boundary, `def:pub` / `def:protect`-as-contract, and state / environment / FFI
declarations -- which were never placement markers to begin with.

## Related diagnostics

- `E5082` -- a plain client import references a symbol with no client-side
  presence (dead import).
- `E5084` -- client code uses a symbol from a bare (Python-ecosystem) import;
  the import stays server-placed, so the client bundle never binds the name.
  Quote the module for npm packages: `import from "react" { useRef }`.
- `E5086` -- client code names one of the module's own declarations that the
  bundle never binds. The build fails instead of shipping a `ReferenceError`.
- `E5087` -- an app whose kind has no server contains code that needs one.
- `E2039` -- access across app entry boundaries (see
  [Workspaces & Apps](apps.md#entry-modules-and-shared-source)).
- `E5104` / `E5105` / `E5106` -- the app DAG, variant
  agreement, and the `pub` bridge surface.
- `W6005` -- a function-typed parameter at an RPC call site.
- `W6006` -- a mutable glob would be dual-emitted (state fork).
- `W6007` -- client code uses a server-placed function as a value and no
  forwarder is possible.
- `W6009` -- the client-side forwarder for an endpoint is async, so it returns
  a `Promise<T>` where the server function returns `T`.
