# Building the compiler

Jac builds its compiler with an independently released Jac executable. The
version, download locations, and SHA-256 hashes live in `pins.json`. The Zig
fetch step verifies the executable on every use, including cache hits. An
installed `jac` and the checkout's Python import path are not bootstrap inputs.
The pin supports Linux x86-64, Linux ARM64, and macOS ARM64. Compiler images
build on a matching host; adding a host requires a verified prior compiler
artifact for that host.

The build graph has explicit artifacts:

1. The pinned compiler builds the native frontend kernel and its class layout.
2. The pinned compiler compiles the current compiler, runtime, CLI, and packaging
   modules into a stage-1 image using ordinary full compilation.
3. Stage 1 builds the typeshed catalog and the launcher. Packaging consumes the
   image, catalog, native libraries, and source-built Python runtime.
4. `compiler-stage2` rebuilds the kernel and image with stage 1. This checks the
   compiler's ability to build its successor independently of the original pin.

The producer executes its own compiled modules. Target sources live in an
isolated temporary snapshot. The historical pin requires an empty `jac0core`
resolver marker in that snapshot; it contains no code and is removed before
publication. The current compiler has no seed transpiler or seed membership list.

```bash
cd jac
zig build fetch-llvm
zig build compiler-image
zig build compiler-stage2
zig build verify-compiler-stage2
zig build verify-compiler-image
zig build
```

`zig-out/compiler-site` is the stage-1 development image. Select it explicitly:

```bash
export JAC_COMPILER_IMAGE="$PWD/zig-out/compiler-site"
./zig-out/bin/jac run ../my-program.jac
```

Rebuild `compiler-image` after changing compiler sources. Unset
`JAC_COMPILER_IMAGE` to use a binary's bundled compiler. A bare source directory
is not an image, and an invalid image is an error. Selection happens before
compiler imports; a process cannot switch its loaded compiler.

The `.compiler-build` cache stores JIR modules using the existing source and
compile-time dependency checks. Its generation includes the producing compiler,
build recipe, source layout, and configuration. Source edits invalidate their
consumers, while a changed producer or recipe starts a new generation. Corrupt
entries are rebuilt. The image codec in `compiler/driver/image.py` owns the wire
format, bytecode loading, and path relocation; application publishing uses the
same codec.

The installed compiler's identity comes from its image manifest. Runtime cache
keys do not rescan a checkout or guess which compiler source tree is active.
`-Dcompiler-jobs=N` controls image workers; the default is two because full
compiler workers can retain several GiB each. Image builds report per-module
cache reuse and elapsed time. Compare cold and warm builds separately.

The experimental `-Djacpython=true` Python build consumes the compiled image
when preparing its private Python compiler dependency image. It does not invoke
a source seed transpiler. The CPython virtual machine and object runtime remain
part of both variants.
