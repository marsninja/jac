# jac single-binary launcher (Jac, dlopen embed)

`jac` is one self-contained executable: a small native launcher stub with the
jaclang runtime + a private CPython appended as a payload. It needs **no system
Python, uv, or pip** at install or runtime. Both halves are Jac:

| Piece | Where | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Launcher stub (`launcher.jac`) | this directory | native (`jac build --as native` / `nacompile`) |
| Fused-runtime library | `jaclang/dist/fused/` | native, shipped in the payload |
| Payload tool (fetch, stage, precompile, pack) | `jaclang/dist/payload/` | Python tier, run on source-built CPython |
| Bootstrap seeds (`build_python.zig`, `fetch_typeshed.zig`), `pins.json` | `bootstrap/` | Zig + the pin files |
| `build.zig` | `jac/` | the one-command entry; also the C/C++ cross-compiler for the LLVM shim and the vendored runtimes |

Instead of statically linking CPython, the launcher **`dlopen`s the bundled
`libpython` at runtime** -- the same way jac-native loads LLVM. The stub links
only libc (and `libdl` on Linux, so it also runs on glibc < 2.34); nothing
Python is linked at build time.

## The fused-runtime library (`jaclang/dist/fused/`)

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `trailer.jac` | The ONE definition of the on-disk trailer format (`JACBIN01` / `JABOVL01`, 80 bytes) and the `rt/<hash16>-<pathhash>` cache key. Pure Jac, so the same source binds on the native pathway (the stub) and the Python pathway (`jaclang.dist.fused_binary`: `jac build --as binary`, the desktop graft, the payload tool's `pack`). |
| `materialize.jac` | Find the trailer at the end of the running executable (stepping over a `.jab` overlay), resolve the cache dir (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` / `$HOME/.cache` / per-uid tmp), and on first run verify (sha256) + extract the payload: `ZstdFile(io.BytesIO(payload))` into `tarfile.open(..., mode="r|").extractall()` -- the bundled native `compression.zstd` / `tarfile` / `io` modules, exactly what CPython would run. Per-pid temp dir, `.ok` marker, atomic rename, GC of this binary's older trees. |
| `embed.jac` | dlopen the bundled libpython (`RTLD_NOW\|RTLD_GLOBAL`), bind the C-API the hosts use (`PyApi`: function-pointer fields filled by `dlsym`), and initialize through the PEP 741 init-config API: home, module search paths and program name go to CPython directly, never through the environment (#7047). Worker mode (`parse_argv`) and print-and-exit flags (`-V`, `-h`) are honoured. |
| `bringup.jac` | `open_runtime(exe)` = materialize + dlopen; `engine_boot()` = the desktop host's bring-up (materialize, dlopen, init with no argv). |
| `report.jac` | `die` (message + exit 70) and `say` (cold-start narration) to stderr, before CPython exists. |
| `_libc.jac` | The portable libc floor: positional reads (`fopen`/`fseeko`/`fread`), directory listing, malloc'd C strings and the `char**` lists PEP 741 takes. |

The OS-specific pieces are bundled native stdlib floors with per-OS variants
(`na_stdlib/_dl_native.{linux,darwin}.jac`, `_exec_native.{linux,darwin}.jac`).

The desktop host (`jaclang/client/targets/desktop`) imports the same
library: the builder stages `fused/` beside the generated host so `import from
fused.bringup { engine_boot }` resolves, and grafts the running jac's
`[ payload ][ trailer ]` onto the host binary. There is no longer a
`libjacpyembed` shim.

## Binary shape

```
jac = [ launcher stub (links libc/libdl only) ][ runtime.tar.zst ][ trailer ]
trailer = "JACBIN01" | payload_len(u64 LE) | sha256_hex(64)   (80 bytes, at EOF)
```

A `jac build --as binary` app binary appends its sealed `.jab` after that, with
its own 80-byte overlay trailer (same codec, distinct magic):

```
app = [ base jac (verbatim) ][ app.jab ][ overlay trailer ]
overlay trailer = "JABOVL01" | jab_len(u64 LE) | sha256_hex(64)
```

The base bytes are the installed `jac`, byte-for-byte: `fused_binary.append_overlay`
copies this binary and appends the `.jab` (no CPython unpack/repack). At boot the
launcher detects the `JABOVL01` marker, steps over the overlay to find the real
payload trailer, and exports `JAC_APP_OVERLAY_OFF/_LEN` so `cli_boot` slices the
`.jab` out of the running binary and mounts it exactly like `jac run app.jab`.

The payload is two concatenated zstd frames (a content-addressed deps frame the
build reuses across runs, and a small per-commit jac frame) whose decoded
concatenation is one tar stream. Materialized to `<cache>/rt/<hash16>-<pathhash>/`
on first run (`<pathhash>` folds in the binary's own path, #7012):

```
python/lib/libpython3.14.{dylib,so}   <- dlopened (RTLD_NOW|RTLD_GLOBAL)
python/lib/python3.14/                 <- stdlib (incl. lib-dynload: extension .so)
site/                                  <- jaclang + _jac_finder
```

## Build

```bash
cd jac

zig build test                       # bootstrap unit tests (no network needed)
zig build stub                       # just the launcher stub (no payload)
zig build                            # -> zig-out/bin/jac
zig build -Djacpython=true            # opt in to the experimental JacPython compiler
./zig-out/bin/jac --version

zig build -Dpayload-progress         # stream the payload build live
zig build -Dpayload=/tmp/p.tar.zst   # pack a prebuilt payload (skip fetch+assemble)
zig build compiler-image            # rebuild the development compiler image
zig build compiler-stage2           # rebuild that image with itself
```

`zig build` first builds CPython from the checksum-pinned sources in
`bootstrap/python/sources.json` and fetches the pinned typeshed stubs. The
Python seed uses Zig for C compilation and archiving, with the upstream
configure/make recipes retained for platform probes and generated files.
The build fetches the checksum-pinned prior Jac compiler and uses it to build
the current compiler image. No installed Python or Jac is needed. See the
[bootstrap guide](../bootstrap/README.md) for the artifact graph and development
image selection.
Build hosts need Zig 0.16.0, make, Perl, a POSIX shell, and network access.
macOS also needs the SDK provided by Xcode command line tools.

`zig build` defaults to CPython's C parser/compiler. `-Djacpython=true` replaces
that compiler with JacPython and embeds its bootstrap seed; the CPython VM and
object runtime are retained in both variants. The flag also applies to
`zig build build-python`, which builds only the Python distribution.
Its cache in `.python-build/<cpython|jacpython>/<platform>` contains the interpreter, shared library, stdlib,
licenses, CA certificates, and static archives for Jac's native backend.
A content fingerprint covers the source checksums, source allowlist, recipes,
Zig version, target, and macOS SDK version. A cache hit skips compilation; a miss builds from
source and checks relocation before marking the distribution complete.
`JAC_PYTHON_JOBS` controls build parallelism (default 4).

Each supported release platform builds on its matching runner. Linux targets
retain the glibc 2.17 floor; ARM macOS targets 11.0. The bootstrap pin currently
supports Linux x86-64/ARM64 and macOS ARM64.
The existing launcher still loads the shared CPython library from its payload.
The source-built runtime excludes Tk, curses, readline, dbm, and CPython test
extensions. `bootstrap/python/cpython-sources.txt` is the source allowlist:
each line names a file or a directory ending in `/`, relative to the pinned
CPython archive. Only those paths survive extraction into the build tree;
the default CPython build also restores the entries marked `# removed:`.
Those marked exclusions apply only with `-Djacpython=true`. Its separate
build-time host restores them to generate the seed, then the reduced runtime
build omits them. JacPython source changes invalidate that runtime's cache;
they do not invalidate the default CPython distribution.
Blank lines and full-line comments are allowed; globs, missing paths, and
overlapping entries fail the build. The archive is still downloaded and
checksum-verified as a whole. Other dependency archives use `sources.json`.

Stable and rolling dev releases build both variants for each selected platform.
The standard `jac-<version>-<platform>` (or `jac-dev-<platform>`) asset uses
CPython; the opt-in asset appends `-jacpython`. Each has its own checksum.
Installers and Docker images consume the standard CPython asset. Intel Mac
remains a manual release target and builds both variants when selected.

The list starts with the C implementations needed by the Linux/macOS release
builds, their headers/generated tables, the Python standard library, and the
upstream configure/make inputs and license notices. Tests and unsupported GUI
packages are excluded. Upstream's default make target still requires
`Programs/_testembed.c`; it is a build prerequisite, not a retained test suite.
Generated files created by configure/make do not need their own source entries.

When a Jac implementation replaces a C component, connect it to the runtime,
update the build recipe, and remove the corresponding source entries and any
unused headers. Split a directory entry into its remaining files before
retiring only part of it. The runtime fingerprint and CI cache keys include
the list, so every change rebuilds and verifies the resulting Python runtime.
Deleting an entry alone does not substitute Jac code for a CPython C API.
The separate ignored CPython reference checkout remains a generator input.
The initial source recipe uses `-O2` without PBS's PGO/LTO optimizations;
performance parity has not been established.

* `JAC_NA_DEBUG=1 jac build --native launcher/launcher.jac` prints why a function in
  the stub's closure would be demoted to Python-only; the stub must lower in
  full (a demoted function cannot run before CPython exists).
* To boot a freshly built stub against an existing payload:
  `jac run` a script that calls `jaclang.dist.fused_binary.graft_runtime(<installed jac>, <stub copy>)`,
  then run the copy with a fresh `HOME`.
* `jac test jac/tests/payload/` covers the trailer codec, deterministic staging,
  frame routing and the payload CLI; the bundled `compression.zstd` / `tarfile`
  equivalence tests cover the decode path the launcher uses.
